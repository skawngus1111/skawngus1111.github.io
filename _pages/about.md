Ju-Hyeon Nam is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Engineering at Inha University, South Korea. 
He is currently conducting his doctoral research under the supervision of Professor Sang-Chul Lee in the Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence (CVAI) Laboratory at Inha University. 
His research interests primarily involve developing reliable deep learning models robust against various corruptions, perturbations, and adversarial attacks using data augmentation techniques. 
Additionally, he actively researches modality-agnostic and domain-generalizable models for medical image segmentation applications across multiple imaging modalities, including colonoscopy, microscopy, dermoscopy, ultrasound, and radiology.

Ju-Hyeon has made significant contributions to medical image processing, frequency-domain analysis, and multi-modality fusion. He has introduced novel methods such as M3FPolypSegNet and MADGNet, which are accepted in ICIP2023 and CVPR2024 for medical image segmentation.

He actively contributes as a reviewer for top-tier conferences, including CVPR (2021-2024), ICCV (2021, 2023), ICLR (2022), and AAAI (2021-2025), and has also reviewed manuscripts for prestigious journals such as Computer Vision and Image Understanding (Elsevier), Pattern Recognition (Elsevier), Journal of Medical Systems (Springer), and IEEE Access.

Ju-Hyeon earned his bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Inha University in 2021 (Summa Cum Laude) and his master's degree in Computer Engineering from the same institution in 2023.
